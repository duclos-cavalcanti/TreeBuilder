\section*{Abstract}
Financial exchanges consider a migration to the cloud for scalability, robustness, and cost-efficiency.
Jasper presents a scalable and fair multicast solution for cloud-based exchanges, 
addressing the lack of cloud-native mechanisms for such. 
To achieve this, Jasper employs an overlay multicast tree, leveraging clock synchronization, kernel-bypass techniques, 
and more.
However, there are opportunities for enhancement by confronting the issue of inconsistent VM performance 
within identical instances. LemonDrop tackles this problem, detecting under-performing VMs in a cluster 
and selecting a subset of VMs optimized for a given application's latency needs.
Yet, we believe that LemonDrop's approach of using time-expensive all-to-all latency measurements and an optimization routine 
for the framed Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) is overly complex. 
The proposed work aims to develop a simpler and scalable heuristic, that achieves reasonably good results
within Jasper's time constraints.
