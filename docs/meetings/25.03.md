### Topics
- [ ] New Formal Solution/Heuristic!
- [ ] One-Page-Summary: State is desirable? 
    - [ ] Overview: How In-Depth should I go about LemonDrop/QAP?
    - [ ] Objectives: Too much? Is it Clear?
    - [ ] Experimental Setup: Is it enough?
- [ ] Kickoff Presentation:
    - [ ] State is desirable?
    - [ ] April 3rd Confirmed? 
- [ ] Remind April 1st/Reocurring Meetups Me, Navidreza, and Haseeb

#### One-Page-Summary
- Overview 
    - [X] Possibly Shorter
    - [X] Clarify challenges/shortcomings 
    - [X] How I want to approach it, Why is not the best current solutions?
    - [X] One Paragraph

- Objectives
    - [X] Move Pseudocode here
    - [X] Things we discussed today, subtasks, how experiments are run, list out the initial ideas

- Experimental Setup: 
    - [X] Place Baselines!
    - [X] One Paragraph is enough!
    - [X] Make setup more concrete!

#### Presentation

- Study assertion evidence method!
- Experimental Setup can be BACKUP!
- How Frequently you run this re-construction?
- How Frequently you perform measurements of latency?
- Sub-Selection: 
    - Hyper-parameters: What are they? Why? How do they affect my Algorithm?
    - Relation: `K` and `N`, Why 20%?
    - Is this a good question at all? Are `K` and `N` to be chosen as well?
