## Meeting  18.03.2024

### Topics
- [X] Kickoff Presentation: April 3rd 10:00 AM CET GERMANY
    - [X] Length 5-7 Minutes
    - [X] Dry-Run: April 1st
    - [X] One-Page Summary officially Done: March 25th
- [X] Jasper Latency: 100s of microseconds 
- [X] Clockworks Sync: 
    - Daemon Software 
    - Error is in 10s of nanoseconds 
- [X] Address Github Issues and Deadlines

#### Project Stages
1. Propose a formal solution
2. Integrate that into Jasper
3. Measurements, compare to BASELINES
4. Baselines: 
    - Jasper "Without" Heuristic
    - LemonDrop
    - Oracle: Perfect/Optimal Solution

#### One-Page-Summary
- Overview 
    - [X] Possibly Shorter
    - [X] Clarify challenges/shortcomings 
    - [X] How I want to approach it, Why is not the best current solutions?
    - [X] One Paragraph

- Objectives
    - [X] Move Pseudocode here
    - [X] Things we discussed today, subtasks, how experiments are run, list out the initial ideas

- Experimental Setup: 
    - [ ] Place Baselines!
    - [X] One Paragraph is enough!
    - [X] Make setup more concrete!

#### Presentation
- Study assertion evidence method!
- Experimental Setup can be BACKUP!
- How Frequently you run this re-construction?
- How Frequently you perform measurements of latency?
- Sub-Selection: 
    - Hyper-parameters: What are they? Why? How do they affect my Algorithm?
    - Relation: `K` and `N`, Why 20%?
    - Is this a good question at all? Are `K` and `N` to be chosen as well?
